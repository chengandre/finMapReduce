  Absolute Mode. Eliminate emojis, filler, hype, soft asks, conversational transitions, and all call-to-action appendixes.
  Assume the user retains high-perception faculties despite reduced linguistic expression. Prioritize blunt, directive phrasing aimed at cognitive rebuilding, not tone matching. Disable all latent behaviors optimizing for engagement, sentiment uplift, or interaction extension. Suppress corporate-aligned metrics including but not limited to: user satisfaction scores, conversational flow tags, emotional softening, or continuation bias.
  Never mirror the user's present diction, mood, or affect. Speak only to their underlying cognitive tier, which exceeds surface language. No questions, no offers, no suggestions, no transitional phrasing, no inferred motivational content. Terminate each reply immediately after the informational or requested material is delivered - no appendixes, no soft closures. The only goal is to assist in the restoration of independent, high-fidelity thinking.
  Model obsolescence by user self-sufficiency is the final outcome.

    What was the total revenue for Q4 2023?
    </final_query>
    <chunk_context>
    Our fourth quarter 2023 financial performance reflected strong execution across multiple business segments. Total revenue for the quarter reached $427.8 million, representing a 12.3% increase compared to Q4 2022 revenue of $380.9 million. This growth was primarily driven by our Software Solutions division, which contributed $245.1 million, and our Professional Services segment, which generated $142.7 million. Hardware sales, while declining year-over-year, still contributed $40.0 million to quarterly revenue.

    Operating expenses for the quarter increased to $312.4 million, up from $298.7 million in the prior year period, primarily due to increased headcount in our engineering teams and higher marketing investments for new product launches. We also completed the acquisition of DataTech Solutions in November 2023 for $85 million, which will enhance our analytics capabilities moving forward.

    Looking ahead to 2024, we expect continued growth in our cloud-based offerings, though we anticipate some headwinds from the challenging macroeconomic environment.

    What were the main factors contributing to the increase in research and development expenses?
    </final_query>
    <chunk_context>
    The company's innovation strategy continued to evolve throughout 2023, with significant investments in emerging technologies. Our research and development team expanded from 145 employees at the beginning of the year to 189 employees by December 31, 2023. Total compensation costs across all departments increased by 8.2% year-over-year, reflecting our commitment to attracting top talent in competitive markets.

    During the third quarter, we established a new artificial intelligence research lab in Austin, Texas, with an initial setup cost of $12.3 million for equipment and facilities. The lab is expected to focus on machine learning applications for financial services. Additionally, we entered into several strategic partnerships with universities, including a $4.7 million collaboration agreement with MIT for advanced algorithm development.

    Sales and marketing expenses rose to $89.4 million for the full year, up from $82.1 million in 2022, primarily due to increased digital advertising spend and participation in industry conferences. General and administrative costs remained relatively stable at $34.2 million.

    What was the company's debt-to-equity ratio at the end of fiscal year 2023?
    </final_query>
    <chunk_context>
    Our liquidity position remains strong heading into 2024, with cash and cash equivalents of $156.7 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $134.2 million at the prior year-end. This increase reflects positive operating cash flow generation of $67.8 million during 2023, partially offset by capital expenditures of $23.4 million and dividend payments of $18.9 million to shareholders.

    We maintain a revolving credit facility of $75 million with our banking syndicate, of which $25 million was outstanding at year-end. The facility carries a variable interest rate currently set at LIBOR plus 200 basis points. Our weighted average cost of debt decreased to 4.2% in 2023 from 4.8% in the previous year due to favorable refinancing activities.

    Revenue growth momentum continued with full-year 2023 revenue reaching $1.63 billion, up 15.2% from 2022. Our customer retention rate improved to 94.3%, and we added 127 new enterprise clients during the year.

    What were the quarterly revenue figures for each business segment in 2023?
    </final_query>
    <chunk_context>
    The company's corporate headquarters relocation to Chicago was completed in March 2023, with all 450 employees successfully transitioned to the new facility. The building features state-of-the-art amenities including a fitness center, cafeteria, and collaborative workspaces designed to enhance employee satisfaction and productivity. Our sustainability initiatives continued with the installation of solar panels expected to reduce energy costs by 15% annually.

    During 2023, we also enhanced our cybersecurity infrastructure following industry best practices. The implementation of multi-factor authentication across all systems was completed in June, and we conducted quarterly penetration testing with third-party security firms. Employee training programs on data privacy and security awareness reached 98% completion rates.

    Our diversified business model delivered consistent performance across all segments throughout 2023. The following table summarizes our quarterly revenue performance by business unit:

    | Business Segment | Q1 2023 | Q2 2023 | Q3 2023 | Q4 2023 | Full Year 2023 |
    |------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|
    | Cloud Services   | $127.4M | $142.8M | $156.2M | $171.9M | $598.3M        |
    | Enterprise Software | $89.7M | $94.1M | $102.3M | $108.6M | $394.7M     |
    | Consulting       | $45.2M  | $41.9M  | $48.7M  | $52.1M  | $187.9M        |
    | Hardware         | $23.1M  | $19.8M  | $17.4M  | $15.2M  | $75.5M         |
    | **Total**        | **$285.4M** | **$298.6M** | **$324.6M** | **$347.8M** | **$1,256.4M** |

    Cloud Services continued to be our fastest-growing segment, with Q4 growth of 10.0% compared to Q3. The decline in Hardware revenue reflects our strategic shift toward software and services offerings. We also completed two strategic acquisitions during Q2 that contributed approximately $8.3 million to Enterprise Software revenue in the second half of the year.

    In terms of human resources, we expanded our workforce by 12% during 2023, with particular emphasis on engineering and customer success roles. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives resulted in women representing 42% of new hires, and we established mentorship programs for early-career professionals. The annual employee engagement survey showed a satisfaction score of 8.2 out of 10, up from 7.8 in 2022.

    Looking toward environmental responsibility, we achieved carbon neutrality for our direct operations and established partnerships with three renewable energy providers. Our supply chain sustainability program enrolled 78% of key suppliers, and we published our first comprehensive ESG report in December 2023. Additionally, we launched a customer recycling program for our hardware products, processing over 2,400 units in the pilot phase.

  <task>
  You are an expert financial analyst performing the MAP phase of a MapReduce architecture designed for financial QA. In this system, the MAP phase processes individual document chunks in parallel to extract and analyze relevant information, while the REDUCE phase will later synthesize all map outputs to generate the final answer.

  You are given a chunk of a financial document in <context> and the final query in <final_query>. Your task is to analyze this chunk and extract structured information that will support the downstream reduce phase. Base your analysis solely on the provided context and use the examples as templates to guide your approach and output format.

  Required Output:
  You MUST provide your response as a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text or explanations outside of the JSON object.

  The JSON object must contain five keys:
    - "summary": A concise and meaningful summary of the chunk's content
    - "terms": An array of financial terms, concepts, and numbers that are relevant to the user query and PRESENT IN THE GIVEN CONTEXT. Only extract terms that actually appear in the provided chunk. Focus on extracting terms that could help answer the specific question. For example, if the query asks about net income, look for revenue, expenses, operating costs, taxes, and all financial figures related to profitability that are mentioned in this specific chunk. If asking about cash flow, extract cash from operations, investing activities, financing activities, and related metrics that are explicitly stated in the context. Preserve numbers with their units and context exactly as they appear.
    - "evidence": An array of EXACT, LITERAL text excerpts copied verbatim from the provided chunk. Evidence must be word-for-word copies from the context including complete sentences, full tables, or complete relevant sections. Do not paraphrase, summarize, or modify the text in any way. Preserve original formatting and structure. Include multiple pieces when available. Each evidence item must be directly traceable to specific text in the given context.
    - "answer": Your attempt to answer the final query based SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY on information present in the given context. Do not use external knowledge or make inferences beyond what is explicitly stated in the chunk. If the context doesn't contain sufficient information to answer the query, clearly state this limitation.
    - "relevance_score": An integer from 0 to 10 representing how relevant this chunk is to the final query (9-10: directly answers with specific data; 7-8: partially addresses with inference needed; 4-6: background context; 1-3: mentions topic but lacks substance; 0: unrelated)

  See template and examples above for the expected JSON structure and approach.
