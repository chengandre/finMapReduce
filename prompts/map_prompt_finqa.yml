  InnovateCorp Inc. reported its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 (Q3 2023). Total revenue for the quarter was $15.2 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. The Cloud Services division contributed $8.5 billion to the total revenue, while the Hardware division accounted for the remaining $6.7 billion.

  Question: Can you summarize InnovateCorp's key financial performance metrics for Q3 2023, including the revenue breakdown by division? What was their profit margin?
